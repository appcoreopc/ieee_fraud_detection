Question about lightgbm 

It is a black box model and its executions is learning features as 'greedy' as possible. 
 
 > How do you tell it, hey don't look at this, but look at this? 
 
 You can't
 
 > How do you say, if this is device info is different, then the weight is obviously higher. 
 
 Give it a weight? 
 
 lightgbm only works with data, if it is in string, then encode it.
